      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tag above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

            <p><strong>Risk Warnings<br></strong>Investment involves risk. The investments discussed in this website may not be suitable for all investors. Investors should make their own investment decisions based upon their own financial objectives and financial resources and, if in any doubt, should seek advice from an investment advisor. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance, the value of investments and the income from them can go down as well as up so an investor may get back less than the amount originally invested. Where investment is made in currencies other than the investor’s base currency, the value of those investments, and any income from them, will be affected by movements in exchange rates. This effect could be unfavourable as well as favourable. Levels and bases for taxation may change.</p>
            <p>Quoted returns are not guaranteed. The Fund Manager's strict application of risk parameters in no way offers a guarantee of capital growth or maintenance. Careful reference should be made to the further fund and product-specific risk factors which are laid out in the relevant material within this website. In particular, investors should read the Offering Memorandum, the Supplement, and the Application Form. Please refer to the “Risk Factors” section of the Offering Memorandum</p>
            <p>Legislation or regulations in your home jurisdiction may prohibit you from investing into the Fund. The Fund Administrator reserves the right to make final determination on whether you are eligible for any products or services. Residents or nationals of certain jurisdictions may be subject to exchange controls and should seek independent advice before investing in the Fund. This website is not a personal recommendation and you should consider whether you can rely upon any opinion or statement contained in this document without seeking further advice tailored for your own circumstances. Neither the Fund Manager nor the Fund are able to provide any advice on the suitability of this investment or the impact on your tax position. Investors are advised to seek investment advice and personal tax advice from a suitably qualified financial professional adviser, lawyer, accountant or bank manager. Neither the Fund Manager nor the Fund can give any guarantee that tax relief or other tax benefits will be available, or that the current tax treatment of the Fund will remain unchanged in the future in the jurisdiction where the prospective investor is a resident or of which he/she is a citizen.</p>
